# Diffusion Models from Scratch

This repository presents a custom implementation of diffusion models, built from scratch, to experiment with image generation on two datasets: Oxford and Stanford. Diffusion models are generative models that sequentially reverse a gradual noising process, creating realistic images from noise.

## Contents

- **Custom Diffusion Model**: A step-by-step implementation of a diffusion model using fundamental principles of diffusion-based generative processes.
- **Oxford and Stanford Datasets**: Experiments conducted on both the Oxford and Stanford datasets to demonstrate the model's capability to learn and generate images from different sources.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Code for training and evaluating the diffusion model, with visualizations of generated samples at various stages of the diffusion process.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Additional libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and any dataset-specific libraries for data handling

## Getting Started
